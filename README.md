# Steaming Game Reviews - Analysis

### Description:
This is a repository for analysing textual reviews in terms of often appearing words or word combinations. We applied the code to two datasets of video game reviews from Steam (https://store.steampowered.com/).
The repository contains the code for the analysis we performed, as well as the datasets. It was created to showcase the experiments we did on the data, and to make it easy to reproduce our results.

### Datasets:
- Main dataset taken from: https://github.com/mulhod/steam_reviews/tree/master
- Additional data on Fallout 4 taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/steam-reviews/data
